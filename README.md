# Revolutionizing the *ENTIRE* world one line at a time

Hello, visitor. Name's Sam Stone. Software developer. I am passionate about video games and the internet.

I currently work part-time at Little Caesars as a backend developer, but I'm looking for full time work. Reach out if you want to!

I'm currently working on a mod for Minecraft. It's almost finished, just need to squash some bugs. Check it out on my CurseForge profile linked below.

Please reach out to me through my socials!
